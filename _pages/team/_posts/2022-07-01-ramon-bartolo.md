bio:
My research focus is how neural populations in the brain processes sensory inputs to extract relevant environmental information and elicit the appropriate behavioral response. Such a decision making process requires inferring the state of the world from the noisy sensory input, then learning the outcomes associated to different stimuli/actions, and also the selecting and executing a specific action to get the desired outcome. This process engages large scale sensorimotor loops.
