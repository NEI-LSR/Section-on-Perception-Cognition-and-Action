Danny joined the lab at the start of 2020, shortly after completing his PhD. He is interested in how and why we see color, and specialises in colorimetry. He is an open science champion, and in his spare time he enjoys hiking in Rock Creek Park and contributing to <a href="https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/welcome">The Turing Way</a>.
