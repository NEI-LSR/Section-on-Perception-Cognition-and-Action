Broadly interested in the neural mechanisms of sensory systems and how learning and development sculpt these systems. 

Currently using functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate how different cortical areas respond to changes in low level visual features such as color and spatial frequency, how visual features such as shape and color are independently and jointly processed, and mapping species similarities in the visual system.
