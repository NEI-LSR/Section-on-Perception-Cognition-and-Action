Welcome to the Lab.

We are the Section on Perception, Cognition, and Action at the Laboratory of Sensorimotor Research, within the National Eye Institute. 

Our research uses a range of tools including psychophysical testing, non-invasive brain imaging (MEG, MRI), and micro-electrode recording, to understand how sense data become perceptions and thoughts. The lab as been especially invested in developing color as a model system, because color transcends scales, from physical (wavelength), to perceptual (hues) and cognitive (categories and memories and emotions). We strongly believe that a team comprising people from diverse backgrounds and perspectives enriches the quality of work we do.
